## Android Twitter Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a basic Twitter client by following a series of exercises. This project is appropriate for someone just starting out with Android development and is following along with the CodePath Android curriculum.

The Twitter client will allow you to log in, view your home timeline, compose a tweet, and view a user profile. Additionally, in the tweet view, you can perform additional actions such as reply, retweet, and favorite.

By the end of this project, you should be familiar with a wide variety of Android concepts that will allow you to build other similar apps such as a Yelp client, an Instagram client, a Mail app, etc. Some of the best apps are a mashup of a few popular APIs!
